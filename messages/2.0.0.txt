1. PSR-4 support is finally here !

   Thanks to @flashios09 and @dakira, we finally managed to get PSR-4 support. 
   The plugin is now able to read your project composer.json and extract psr-4 information in autoload and autoload-dev settings.

   With this big improvement, we do not need `start_dir_pattern` and `namespace_prefix` settings anymore.
